### CS509 Airline Reservation System 
The app is written in Java with a console based UI on a remote server established by the lecturer of WPI CS509, and is conceptually similar in behavior to existing web-based airline reservation systems such as kayak.com or expedia.com. 

The system allows user to:
1. Search either non-stop flights or connecting flights with a maximum of two layovers by defining the departure/arrival airport, departure/return date, trip type, and seat class.
2. View search results with correct flight information.
3. Sort and filter search results.
4. Reserve either one-way or round-trip flights.
5. Reserve selected flight(s) and receive reservation confirmation from the system.
